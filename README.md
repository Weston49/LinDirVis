# LinDirViz

##Usage
To get started just run make which should compile the main file and run the examples shell script. This should make some ex\*.pdf files that show off the different vizualizations you can generate.

#ex6.pdf
This one will look vastly different depending on where you run it from, it calls LinDirViz on the directory above the current one and just generates the tree. Here is what it looks like on my Mac when I run it.
